# SummitOS Development Roadmap (v2)

This document outlines the path from a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to a full, production-ready "SummitOS" application, incorporating critical feedback on safety, legal, and architectural soundness.

### ✅ Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - COMPLETE!

**Goal:** Prove the core software loop: a web application that can grant or deny gate access based on a tenant's status, with a simple way to manage the data and simulate gate access.

**1. Foundational Setup (✅ *Completed*)**
   - **[Done]** Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
   - **[Done]** Define and create the core database schema (`units`, `tenants`, `gate_logs`) in Supabase.
   - **[Done]** Build a basic dashboard UI to display facility status.
   - **[Done]** Implement the core gate access logic at the `/api/gate/access` endpoint.
   - **[Done]** Implement basic CRUD forms for Tenants and Units on the dashboard.

**2. Gate Access Simulation (✅ *Completed*)**
   - **[Done]** Build a "Gate Simulator" page (`/gate-simulator`) to test the gate access API without physical hardware.

**3. Testing Infrastructure (✅ *Completed*)**
   - **[Done]** Comprehensive E2E test suite with Playwright
   - **[Done]** Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - **[Done]** Integration tests for critical API endpoints
   - **[Done]** Automated testing pipeline

### ✅ Phase 1.5: The Financial Foundation - COMPLETE!

**Goal:** Connect the gate logic to real financial data, laying the groundwork for automated collections.

**1. Payment Integration Setup (✅ *Completed*)**
   - **[Done]** Integrated the Stripe API for payment processing (manual payment logging).
   - **[Done]** Fixed Stripe API configuration and UUID validation issues.
   - **[Done]** End-to-end payment flow testing completed.

**2. The Ledger (✅ *Completed*)**
   - **[Done]** Created the `transactions` table in Supabase to log all financial events.
   - **[Done]** Implemented a database trigger to automatically update tenant balances.
   - **[Done]** Payment processing with automatic tenant unlock functionality.

---

### Phase 2: Production-Ready Application

**Goal:** Build out the full, robust, and autonomous system, incorporating AI agents, real hardware integration, and payment processing.

**1. Full Payment Automation**
   - **Task:** Build an automated monthly billing system using a scheduled function (cron job) to create a new charge transaction for each tenant.
   - **Task:** Create a secure Tenant Portal where customers can self-serve: view their balance and transaction history, update their payment methods, and pay their bills via Stripe.

**2. AI Agent Implementation (The "Brain")**
   - **Task:** Integrate LangGraph to build stateful AI agents.
   - **[In Progress] "The Enforcer"** (Collections Agent):
     - **[Done]** Core agent logic implemented with LangGraph (fetches tenant data, drafts messages).
     - **[Done]** "Human-in-the-Loop" UI (review modal) integrated into the dashboard.
     - **[Done]** Mock SMS sending API implemented for testing.
     - **Task:** Implement **Legal Guardrails** (monitor tenant balances, trigger communication workflows).
     - **Task:** Replace mock SMS with actual Twilio (or similar) integration.
   - **Task:** Build **"The Closer"** (Sales Agent) and **"The Steward"** (Maintenance Agent).

**3. Hardware & IoT Integration (The "Body")**
   - **Task:** Set up and configure the on-site local server (e.g., Raspberry Pi) and IoT relays.
   - **[In Progress] "The Watcher"** (Computer Vision) for license plate recognition:
     - **[Done]** Database updated to store `license_plate` for tenants.
     - **[Done]** API endpoint (`/api/gate/identify`) created for license plate identification.
     - **[Done]** Simulated LPR camera (`camera_simulator.py`) implemented and tested.
   - **[In Progress] "The Gatekeeper"** (IoT):
     - **[Done]** Python script (`gate_controller.py`) implemented for polling `gate_logs`.
     - **[Done]** Local caching mechanism for offline redundancy (initial implementation).
     - **Task:** Implement a **Local Failover Protocol (Critical Safety)**:
       - The cloud application will periodically *push* a list of all valid gate codes to the local on-site server.
       - If the internet connection fails, the local server will operate using this cached list, ensuring tenants are never locked out due to a network outage.

**4. Production Hardening & Scalability**
   - **[Done]** Automated Integration Tests (`jest`) for critical API endpoints are established and passing.
   - **[Done]** Comprehensive E2E test suite covering full tenant lifecycle including payments.
   - **[Done]** Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   - **[Done]** Environment variable configuration and loading verified.
   - **[CRITICAL]** Implement robust Supabase authentication with distinct roles for admins and tenants.
   - **[CRITICAL]** Fix security vulnerabilities before production deployment.
   - **Task:** Establish a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployments.

## 🚨 **SECURITY STATUS: CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES**

### 🔴 **IMMEDIATE SECURITY CONCERNS**
- **Hardcoded Stripe API key** in payment route
- **No Row Level Security** - database completely open
- **Missing API authentication** - all endpoints unprotected
- **No input validation** - vulnerable to injection attacks
- **Information disclosure** in error messages

### 📋 **SECURITY ROADMAP**
- **Phase 1** (Week 1): Fix critical vulnerabilities
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 2-3): Enhanced security features
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 4-6): Military-grade security

**See [SECURITY_PLAN.md](./SECURITY_PLAN.md) and [SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed security implementation plan.**
